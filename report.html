<h1 class="title01"><b> Exploring MapBox as a solution for the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance Website </b></h1> 
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> Problem: </b></h2> 
<p>There are no good maps about the Baxter Creek Watershed. As a result, visitors to the area are not aware of the Baxter Creek Watershed and it's ecological or natural features.They may get lost whilst using the trails and miss key points of interest. </p>  
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> Solution: </b></h2>
<p>To create a thematic map to display and educate the general public on the Baxter Creek Watershed, using MapBox and Leaflet then compare the two to see which program creates a better thematic map.</p>   
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> What is MapBox? </b></h2>
<p>MapBox is an online tool that gives people real time access to navigation tools, maps and data. They are responsible for the technology behind many apps that help people navigate to where they need to be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Thousands of companies utilize MapBox services in aid of navigational software in cars and smartphones. There are over 600 million monthly active users that trust their ability to run their services. This is a global service delivering to customers in farming, manufacturing, ecommerce and more industries.</p> 
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b>Why use MapBox? </b></h2> 
<p>MapBox has the compacity to deliver results for hundreds of different types of services needed by anyone from the average person to multi-million dollar companies. They are constantly updating their services to keep up with industry requirements. There are many options of Mapbox to fully supply any services needed of a client. The clientelle ranges from BMW to National Geographic to CNN. </p>  
<br>	

<!--Solution Steps-->  
<h2 class="title02"><b>Solution Steps: </b></h2> 
<p>Below are the steps we took to create the map featured on this page using the MapBox interface: </p>
<br>	

<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 1: Hosting Information </b></h2> 
<p>To start, we need a way of storing the information and final outputs for this project. We decided that Github would be the most effective way for all the members to contribute equally. So, a group Github repository was created for Group4. All the files used in this website are hosted there.</p> 
<br>	
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 2: MapBox Studio Manual - MapBox</b></h2> 	
<p>The group created MapBox01.html using the MapBox Studio Manual using the MapBox GL JS featured. </p> 
<img src="/Group4/pics/MApBoxManual.png" alt="MapBoxGuide" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
<br>
	

<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 3: ArcGIS Pro - Problem - Feature Class to GeoJSON  </b></h2> 	 
<p>We started by bringing the Baxter Creek trail file to ArcGIS Pro in order to export the data as a GeoJSON file so that we would be able to bring it into the MapBox Editor. The original plan was to bring them into MapBox as GeoJSON files but that created an error within MapBox upon upload. We could not directly create the trail data within the MapBox Editor so we had to determine a work around to be able to upload the data. We realized that we were able to upload different file types so we decided to test if a shapefile would upload properly and not cause the same error. </p>
<img src="/Group4/pics/uploadfail2.png" alt="UploadFail" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<br>
	
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 4: Converted MVT_Trails_Feature - Feature Class to Shapefile </b></h2> 	  
<p> The MVT_Trails_Features Feature Class was downloaded from ArcGIS Online and converted to shapefile after the GeoJSON upload technique failed. After converting the Baxter Creek Trails Feature Class to a Shapefile we then uploaded it onto ArcGIS Online so we could download it. This was then uploaded to MapBox as a Custom Tilesets. We repeated this process with the two sets of point data which we created as Feature Classes directly within ArcGIS Pro. Those two points being one to represent a fishing spot along the river and one to represent the artesian well in the area.</p>  
<img src="/Group4/pics/toshapefile.png" alt="ShapeFile"  style="width:400px;height:350px;">
<br>
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 5: Add shapefiles within the Custom Tilesets to MapBox Editor</b></h2> 	
<p> With the new solution we were able to add the shapefiles to the MapBox Editor with success. In order to properly import these files we  had to ZIP the files in order to actually bring them into MapBox. This was the workflow that finally allowed us to bring our data into MapBox! </p>  
<img src="/Group4/pics/success.png" alt="success">
<br>
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 6: Bring Custom Tilesets into Outdoors Basemap</b></h2> 	  
<p>After thy were added in as new layers, they were connected to the map as Custom Tilesets which were then added onto the map. The point symbols do not allow us to change the symbols. In order to change them we would have had to download individual symbols for each point in order to edit the design. </p> 
 <img src="/Group4/pics/editingcolours.png" alt="colours">
<br>
 
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 7: Iframe</b></h2> 	
<p> The zoom level needed to edited to allow the map to be properly visible within the Iframe. We used iframe to put one interactive map html into another webpage. We did this to better control the dimension of the map frame.</p>  
<br> 

<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 8: Continued Information Collection</b></h2> 	
<p> We realized after finishing the map that there was a link in the bottom right corner of the map which states "Improve this map". Upon clicking the link the user is sent to a page where they are able to add in their own information/data. After entering their information they are promted to enter their email which will allow them to recieve a conformation email from MapBox stating that their data is under review by the MapBox team before it is added to the map. The screenshot below is the conformation email the user will recieve after entering their data.</p>

<h1 class="title01"><b> Exploring Leaflet as a solution for the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance website </b></h1> 
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> Problem: </b></h2> 
<p>There are no good maps about the Baxter Creek Watershed. As a result, visitors to the area are not aware of the Baxter Creek Watershed and it's ecological or natural features.They may get lost whilst using the trails and miss key points of interest. </p>  
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> Solution: </b></h2>
To create a thematic map to display and educate the general public on the Baxter Creek Watershed, using Leaflet.</p>   
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> What is Leaflet? </b></h2>
<p> The map featured on this page was created using Leaflet. Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Leaflet features expansive libraries of third party plugins to choose from when creating your map. These range from, but are not limited to, tile & image layers, types of overlay displays and different types of user interfaces. These plug-ins are simple and effective to use. </p> 
<br>
<h2 class="title02"><b> Why use Leaflet? </b></h2> 
<p> Leaflet is open source, which means the original source code of Leaflet is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Secondly, Leaflet is light weight and mobile friendly. It works across a variety mobile and desktop platforms. Thirdly, the Leaflet API is well documented, with a focus on being easy to use. Lastly, there is a strong community behind Leaflet that makes it possible. </p>  
<br>	

<!--Solution Steps-->  
<h2 class="title02"><b> Solution Steps: </b></h2> 
<p> Below are the steps we took to create the map featured on this page: </p>
<br>	

<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 1: Hosting Information </b></h2> 
<p>A group Github repository was created for Group4. All files used in this website are hosted there.</p> 
<br>	
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 2: Quick Start Guide - Leaflet </b></h2> 	
<p> The group created CreateLeaflet.html using the Quick Start Guide featured <a href="https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/" target="popup" onclick="window.open('https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/','popup','width=1280,height=720'); return false;">Here</a>. This guide used the mapbox/streets-v11 tiles from Mapbox’s Static Tiles API. In order to use this, we were asked to use an access token. Thus, we requested the public default access token to use the tile layer from MapBox. We experienced difficulties using this token and accessing the tile layer. </p> 
<img src="/Group4/pics/QuickStartGuide.jpg" alt="Quick Start Guide of Leaflet">
<br>
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 3: Simple Leaflet Examples - Github </b></h2> 	 
<p> Alternative examples in Github were turned to understand how to integrate tiles into the map we were creating. The following examples were used to understand how different plugins looked once deployed from Github. Even though they were slightly complex to follow along with at times, it helped in understanding the basics of using Leaflet. These examples were created by <a href="map:https://github.com/Lapizistik/leaflet-examples" target="popup" onclick="window.open('map:https://github.com/Lapizistik/leaflet-examples','popup','width=1280,height=720'); return false;">by Klaus Stein</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StephSaephan/leaflet-map-example" target="popup" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/StephSaephan/leaflet-map-example','popup','width=1280,height=720'); return false;">Stephanie Saephan</a> in Github.</p>  
<img src="/Group4/pics/LeafletExampleLapiz.jpg" alt="Leaflet Example">
<br>

<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 4: Implement Tiles</b></h2> 	 
<p>This webpage created by <a href="https://maptimeboston.github.io/leaflet-intro/" target="popup" onclick="window.open('https://maptimeboston.github.io/leaflet-intro/','popup','width=1280,height=720'); return false;">Andy Woodruff, Ryan Mullins and Cristen Jones</a>  for Maptime Boston featured a rather simple tutorial to Leaflet which the group eneded up using. We used their example to integrate the tile layer: OpenStreetMap.Mapnik from <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/" target="popup" onclick="window.open('http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/','popup','width=1280,height=720'); return false;">here</a> into our map using JQuery. There was difficulty in downloading JQuery v3.6.0 from jquery.com in Chrome, Mozilla and Edge for some time for reasons unknown. However, the JQuery Javascript library was downloaded and uploaded to the repository.</p> 
<img src="/Group4/pics/MapBoston.jpg" alt="Leaflet Example">
<br>
	
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 5: Converted MVT_Trails_Feature shape file to GeoJSON file</b></h2> 	  
<p>The MVT_Trails_Features shape file was downloaded from ArcGIS Online and converted  to GeoJSON using ArcGISPro using the Features to GeoJSON conversion tool. This was uploaded to the Group 4 repository and accessed/added to the current map using Javascript.</p>  
<img src="/Group4/pics/MVT.jpg" alt="Trails">
<br>
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 6: Created points Fishing Spots using geojson.io</b></h2> 	
<p>The group used geojson.io to create hypothetical fishing points in the Baxter Creek Water Shed. This GeoJSON file was saved to the Group 4 Github repository. These points were edited to represent fishing icons and added to the current map using Javascript.</p>  
<img src="/Group4/pics/FishingSpots.jpg" alt="Fishing Spots">
<br>
	
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 7: Map formatting and Sizing Difficulties</b></h2> 	  
<p>When resizing the map, there seemed to be conflict  with the custom css file. Percentage sizings did not work whilst fixed pixel sizings did.</p> 
<br>
 
<h2 class="title02"><b>Step 8: Iframe</b></h2> 	
<p> We used iframe to put one interactive map html into another webpage. We did this to better control the dimension of the map frame.</p> 
<br> 

<h2 class="title02"><b> Conclusion </b></h2>
<p> We had originally planned on using Google MyMaps to create our map but after testing it out for a few hours we believed that the interface was too simple. So we decided to use MapBox and Leaflet as an alternative. We knew that we wanted to learn more about Leaflet and MapBox services, so we thought the best way to do that would be to compare the capabilities of each of the interface by creating a similar map. After completing our maps, we found that Leaflet was significantly more user-friendly with its components and tools than MapBox's. While MapBox has many different default maps to choose from, the MapBox team found it extremely difficult to actually be able to make progress towards creating a map whereas the Leaflet team made progress almost instantly because their interface made it easier to actually add data into a map layout. Based on our obervations we came to the conclusion that the thematic map created by the Leaflet interface was significantly better visually and technically than the one created by MapBox.</p>
